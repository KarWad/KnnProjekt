## Overview
The purpose of this module is to implement three classifiers (knn, decision tree, multinomial naive bayes) on the feature vectors generated in lab 1. This module is built on the preprocessing module that sanitized a set of SGML documents representing a Reuters article database into a dataset of feature vectors and class labels. The results of the classifiers will be employed in future assignments for automated categorization, similarity search, and building document graphs.

## Description
This python module contains the following files and directories:

* lab2.py - main module for KDD process
* preprocessing/
    * \_\_init\_\_.py
    * preprocessing.py - module for preprocessing the Reuters article database
    * document/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * document.py - sub-module for text extraction & tokenization of document objects
    * lexicon/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * lexicon.py - sub-module for generating the title/body lexicon for document set 
    * feature/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * feature.py - sub-module for generating feature vector datasets
        * weighting.py - sub-module for computing tf-idf scores
        * featureselect.py - sub-module for feature selection/reduction
* classification/
    * \_\_init\_\_.py
    * classification.py - module for classification of the feature vector datasets
    * crossvalidator/
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * crossvalidator.py - submodule containing functionality for cross validation 
    * classifiers
        * \_\_init\_\_.py
        * knearestneighbor.py - submodule for brute force knn classification
        * knearestneighbor_balltree.py - submodule for ball tree knn classification
        * decisiontree.py - submodule for decision tree classification 
        * bayesian.py - submodule for multinomial naive bayes classification
* data/
    * reut2-xxx.sgm - formatted articles (replace xxx from {000,...,021})

The `preprocessing.py` file will generate the following files

* dataset1.csv - regular feature vector set
* dataset2.csv - pared down version of feature vector in dataset1.csv

The feature vectors in the datasets were generated using the following methodologies

* TF-IDF of title & body words to select the top 5 words of each document features
* Feature reduction process of paring down original feature vector to 10% original size

Potential additional to future iterations of feature vector generation:

* different normalization
* bigram/trigram/n-gram aggregation
* stratified sampling: starting letter, stem, etc.
* binning: equal-width & equal-depth (grouping by topics/places, part-of-speech, etc)
* entropy-based discretization (partitioning based on entropy calculations)

The `classification.py` file will produce the following 4x2 experiment results:

* Brute Force KNN for feature vector 1
* Brute Force KNN for feature vector 2
* Ball Tree KNN for feature vector 1
* Ball Tree KNN for feature vector 2
* Decision Tree for feature vector 1
* Decision Tree for feature vector 2
* Naive Bayes for feature vector 1
* Naive Bayes for feature vector 2

For more information on how these classifiers were implemented and the offline/online costs, use the command:

## Usage
This module relies on several libraries to perform preprocessing, before anything:

Ensure NLTK is installed and the corpus and tokenizers are installed:

```
> pip install NLTK
```

Next, enter a Python shell and download the necessary NLTK data:

```
> python
$ import nltk
$ nltk.download()
```

From the download window, ensure `punkt`, `wordnet` and `stopwords` are downloaded onto your machine.

```

Next, ensure BeautifulSoup4 is installed:

```
> pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Lastly, ensure scikit-learn is installed:

```
> pip install scikit-learn
```

To run the code, first ensure the `preprocess.py` file has execute privileges:

```
> chmod +x preprocess.py
```

Next, ensure the `preprocessing/` and `classification/` directories and their filetrees are correct with respect to `lab2.py` (based on the file tree in the overview). Also,
ensure there is a `data/` directory in the same folder as `preprocess.py` and the `data/` directory containing the `reut2-xxx.sgm` files is present. To begin preprocessing the data, run:

```
> python lab2.py
```

or

```
> ./lab2.py
```

The preprocessing and classification might take some time to complete.

Once `preprocessing.py` finishes execution, two datasets files are generated (`dataset1.csv`, `dataset2.csv`) in the `/datasets` directory. To view these datasets, run:

```
> less datasets/datasetX.csv
```

where `X` is replaced with 1 or 2 depending on the dataset.

Once `classification.py` finishes execution, the results of the 2x2 experiments will be outputted to the terminal.

## Development
* This module was developed using python 2.7.10 using the NLTK and BeautifulSoup4 modules.

### Adding More Feature Vectors
* Update the \_\_select\_features method in feature.py to extract a new list of feature vector & append to self.features 

### Adding More Classifiers
* Add a new .py file to the classification/classifiers/ directory
* Ensure this new classifier is a class with a construct and at least two methods:
    * build_model(training)
    * test_model(test) 
* Let the parameters @training and @test be the training and test sets generated by the CrossValidator object
* Import the classifier in classification.py, add an instance of the classifier to @classifiers, and the print strings
